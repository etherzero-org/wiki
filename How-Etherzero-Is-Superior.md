# How EtherZero is superior than Ethereum at some point? You have to read this

* To the general public, blockchain networks like Ethereum sometime seem like a magical alternative compared with traditional payment systems: phrases like “free transactions” and “instant payments” are common.

* The reality is far less glamorous: Blockchains can be very slow, and transactions are far from free. Luckily, EtherZero and its novel consensus mechanism offers a highly promising solution.

## Now let's talk about how etherzero make the ZERO FREE to become an reality

* With the help of Power mechanism (here refered Power),you will pay no fees in Etherzero Network. 
* Power is the Etherzero initialization token coin, it is generated by PoS, can not trading on exchange ,and only used to as the gas to be burned and will be return back to a certain amount as times flies away in Etherzero blockchain. Any accounts with 0.01 above will increasing their power of value until reach the ceils
* Etherzero take Euler number when process the power  back to normal speed.

* And in Etherzero Network,we used the parameters like as:

## Ethereum’s introduction of smart contracts marked a revolution in the minds of the startup community: Now anyone could create and crowdfund an innovative project without dealing with venture funds, could accept and send money without banks, and could conclude risk-free deals. Indeed, a smart contract – a program that self-executes whenever a set of predetermined conditions are met – can be written for just about any deal. Unsurprisingly, hundreds of blockchain sprung up, all using Ethereum smart contracts to distribute their tokens (with the hope that their future goods and services would be sold via smart contracts, too)

## Ethereum woes

* It quickly became apparent that Ethereum had flaws – serious ones. For starters, the overall speed of the network is only as high as that of each individual computer, or node, in it, which sometimes causes the system to lag and even freeze. At present, it takes several minutes (and an average fee of $0.08) to process a payment. Making Ethereum faster as it grows – scaling it – is a subject of much debate, and there is zero hope that the blockchain will reach the processing speeds of Visa or MasterCard anytime soon.
* Yet another issue is the sheer wastefulness of the consensus algorithm being used: proof-of-work. As all miners race to find the solution to the cryptographic puzzle needed to complete each block and thus receive a reward, enormous amounts of electricity are used, which causes concerns for environmentalists. Finally, Ethereum smart contracts have to be written in Solidity, a language outside the skillset of the average coder.

## EtherZero: from PoW to MPoS

* EtherZero is a fork of Ethereum that aims to solve the current issues and create a fast, affordable, and easy-to-use framework for blockchain startups. After working on many Solidity projects for clients, the founders realized that the slowness, low efficiency, and high fees for running smart contracts were killing many promising startups. It soon became clear to the founders that in order to achieve wide adoption, the community needed a blockchain hundreds of times faster than Ethereum with zero transaction fees a different, more efficient consensus mechanism.
* After months of intense work, the EtherZero team completed a new hybrid consensus protocol called MPoS, or Masternodes + Proof-of-Stake. In it, any user with at least 20,000 EtherZero coins in their wallet can launch a so-called masternode – a node that maintains an up-to-date fully copy of the blockchain in exchange for a fixed regular income. To run a masternode, a user must keep their server up and running 24/7 and have enough free space to accommodate the entire set of data (for instance, the Ethereum blockchain’s current size is circa 140 GB). The 20,000 ETZ requirement ensures that every masternode has a serious stake in the system and will not risk it by turning malicious.

## Etherzero MPoS mechanism

* EtherZero’s MPoS algorithm is based on the second approach we mentioned above, which is the block must be completed by trusted signer. Because each block seen by each node can match the list of trusted witnesses. One of the challenge that we are facing is how to maintain changable authorized witness list, so we adopt systematic smart contract to guarantee that every round of maintenance of authorized witness list to be included within the block and header extra-data. This would also increases the security of the primary masternode account from another perspective and invalidates the block header of the miner address. Below is showing our blockchain storage:

* MPoS has a higher mecIn the PoW consensus, the excessive concentration of computing power makes 51% of the computing powers increase the hidden dangers. In the EtherZero network, if you want to launch an attack, you must control 51% of the entire network to achieve the purpose of tampering with the transaction. With the number of masternodes increasing, the security of the EtherZero network will be further enhanced. Now, after the main network getting online for only one day, we have more than 100 masternodes already, and in the future, there would be more and more masternodes.

## Towards a faster, free, more secure environment

* The EtherZero network was launched in August 2018, and its performance has far exceeded expectations. Thanks to the transfer from PoW to MpoS, the system processes around 1500 transactions per second, with an average waiting time of just about a second – as opposed to several minutes on Ethereum. The new consensus protocol also protects the system from most common types of attacks. All coin transfers are completely free, creating the perfect environment for developing new blockchain projects. What’s more, EtherZero is fully backwards compatible with all Solidity smart contracts, meaning that any contract designed for the main Ethereum network can be easily imported and activated on the EtherZero blockchain. As part of the testing process, the developers successfully imported a wide range of projects, including decentralized exchanges, token emission contracts, investment apps, and games. The framework features its own ready-to-use exchange, stable coin, wallets, e-commerce and OTC space, and much more.

* The combination of an extremely high capacity and zero fees make EtherZero the perfect environment for blockchain projects of all types and sizes, from data storage to games, token offerings, and quality control. The network has been running smoothly since its launch, with the highest level of security ensured by a specially designed parameter of Power, an untraded, PoS-generated origin token that helps prevent malicious transactions.
